# transmetropolitan

In the rosy parks of England

We'll sit and have a drink

Of VP wine and cider 'til we can hardly think

And we'll go where the spirits take us

To heaven or to hell

And kick up bloody murder in the town we love so well

Going transmetropolitan

From the dear old streets of King's Cross

To the doors of the ICA
